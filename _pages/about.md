Welcome to the Canadian Indicator Framework for the Sustainable Development Goals Data Hub, hosted by Statistics Canada.

Statistics Canada is central focal point for reporting Canada's data for the global SDG indicators and works as a co-ordinating body for the National Statistical System. Statistics Canada is responsible for the collection, collation, analysis, presentation and dissemination of data for regular monitoring of Canadian progress against the global indicators and has developed this on-line data hub for disseminating Canada's SDG data.

Statistics Canada is continuing to examine data sources that may be useful for reporting on SDGs and over the coming months will continue to add data, statistics, and data visualization features. By clicking on each Goal you will find Canada's Statistics for the Sustainable Development Goal Indicators.
